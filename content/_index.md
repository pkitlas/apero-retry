description: My research and teaching explore the intersection of global intellectual history and Islamic studies across the Mediterranean. I bring to these endeavors years of cross-cultural experience living in the Middle East and a strong commitment to building community. Through my work as a historian and educator I aim to showcase how the complexities of the past inform our connected, human present.
