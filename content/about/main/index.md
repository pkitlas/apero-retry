  My current research explores the role of Muslim actors and Islamic value-systems in the creation of our modern world. My current book project *Islamic Diplomacies in a Connected Mediterranean* examines the lives and writings of Moroccan and Ottoman ambassadors who traveled throughout the 18th century Mediterranean. I argue for the inclusion of these North African and Ottoman voices in histories of international thought, drawing on their travelogues, correspondence, diplomatic manuals, and biographical dictionaries to offer a connected history of diplomacy in the Mediterranean.
  
  I offer classes on the __Modern Middle East__, __Premodern Islamic World__, and the __Mediterranean__. In my teaching I combine discussions on primary source material, project-based activities, and authentic assessments to foster a community-oriented learning space where students are encouraged to think about how studying the past better informs our understanding of a connected, global present.
