  My current research explores the role of Islam in the creation of modern diplomacy and international thought. To do so, I examine the lives and writings of Moroccan and Ottoman ambassadors who traveled throughout the 18th century Mediterranean. I explore their travelogues, correspondence, diplomatic manuals, and biographical dictionaries to better understand how they thought about and practiced diplomacy.
