## Course Description

What do the poet Rumi, bureaucrat Sari Mehmed Pasha, and comics author G. Willow Wilson have in common? They are all Muslim theorists of friendship. In this class we will explore the relationship between Islam and friendship across time and space. We begin with the poetry of Rumi and others to understand how Islamic mystics define friendship with God. We will then look to Islamic political theorists, past and present, to determine how friendship is deployed in international relations. Comparing Ottoman imperial handbooks and speeches from figures like Ayatollah Khomeini we will ask: how is friendship a limiting or liberating construct in international relations? We end with a focus on personal friendship(s). With an eye to anthropological theories, we will look at friendship across religious divides in Palestine, representations in graphic novels, and female kinship in historical fiction.
