  description: "My teaching philosophy centers on engagement with primary sources through collaborative discussion, project-based activities, and authentic writing assessments. In developing content for my courses I connect the past and present so that students have the opportunity to reflect on how the complexities of the past inform their current experiences. Though historical in focus, my classes aim to include a wide range of voices and interests. In a recent course review from *The Clash of Civilizations?* an engineering student commented that it *greatly increased [their] respect for liberal arts and the conversations that can arise in historical and political debate.* Here, you can find a more detailed description of my [Teaching Philosophy.](/files/0_TeachingStatement.pdf) You can also browse through my past courses with highlights of readings and activities, plus their full syllabi."
